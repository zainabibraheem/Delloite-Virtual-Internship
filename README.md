# Delloite-Virtual-Internship (Tha Forage)
This repo contains my task from the Deloitte Virtual Internship (Job Simulation) on The Forage. The internship focused on data analysis, visualization, and business insights using Tableau and Excel.


### Project Overview

1.  Task 1: Data Visualization Dashboard (Tableau)

  - Task: Analyse the client's data and Create a dashboard using Tableau.

    Your task is to analyse the telemetry data collected by Daikibo in a software called Tableau. Here are the steps that you need to take:

    - Download the daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip file -> unzip -> and import it in Tableau.
    - Create a calculated measure field called "Unhealthy" with a value of 10 for every unhealthy status (representing 10 mins of potential down time since the previous message).
    - Create a bar chart called “Down Time per Factory”.
    - Create a new sheet with a new bar chart called “Down Time per Device Type”.
    - Create a Dashboard with the 2 previous sheets and set the first chart to be used as a filter (selecting a factory in the first chart shows only the down time of the machines in this factory in the second chart).
    - Select the factory with the most down time (click on its bar), make a screenshot of the dashboard and upload it as a submission for this task.

  - Execution: Processed and analyzed client's data. Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key trends. Created charts, KPIs, and insights to assist business decisions. 📂

2. Task 2: Employee Compensation Analysis (Excel)

- Task: Help a client draw conclusions from data.
   Here is your task:

   - Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
Examples:

10 → Fair
-9 → Unfair
-30 → Highly Discriminative

- Execution: Processed and analyzed employee compensation data. Classified Equality Scores into Fair, Unfair, and Highly Discriminative categories. Used Excel formulas, Pivot Tables, and visualizations to derive insights.
